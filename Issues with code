/* sorry if these are beginner questions but I am still unsure about the following: 

- When do I use {} and when do I not have to? 
-When do I not need to use arrow syntax?
- What is the difference between using 'const' and 'function' for a function? 
- What is the difference between '===' and '=='? */
